Keep in mind we're trying our best to keep the code clean and modular so that we can add and remove things easily in case
we need to renovate anything in the future. :)

Current agenda:
- Procedural Animation, a basic sprite-sheet generator given Doom's templates.
- Inventory, basic inventory system for players.
- Combat system, will be drafted out idea-wise.
- Tile/resource system
- Crafting system
- Building system
- Monsters
- STP (Supple Treat Point) system-- essentially admin reward system for roleplay/writing.
- Levels/character progression and skill system. (This will most likely have a cap)
- Party system.
- Guilds/Village (?)
- Saving/Loading characters.
- NPC Dialog system
- Communication system (I'd like to see some sort of overlay bubble text over mobs if psosible, but if not, we could just
use the chatbox again)

Completed:
- Mouse Engine
- Basic tiles
- Basic sprite
